Personal notes used to pass the OSWP exam

How to open: 
You need obsidian to open this notebook, although you can pretty much read it on github or with any parser of Markdown.

If you use obsidian, download the repo, unpack it and choose to open a folder as notebook:

Navigate to the folder and use that, should load. It will ask you for permissions to open the notebook from an untrusted author. You can yourself check the contents of the repo to make sure there is nothing that will harm your computer in here.

Enjoy!
